Things to remember:
    - Every time we log on to instance: cd $AWS_FPGA_REPO_DIR && source vitis_setup.sh && cd
    - 164.4/max = performance in GFLOPs
    - Make sure make estimate doesn't take longer than 12 hours (or even 20 minutes ideally)
    - Keep applying optimization until your kernel occupies about 80% of these resources (make resource)

Things to try:
    - Specify #pragma HLS inline off inside the function body to reduce synthesis time
    - Need to implement pipeline and unrolls
        - Mess with array partitioning
    - LOOP TRANSFORMATIONS
    - Sliding window
    - Reduction
